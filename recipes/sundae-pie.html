        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Burger King Hershey’s sundae pie is a decadent dessert that tastes almost like a cross between a chocolate pie and ice cream.
            It has two beautiful layers – cream cheese and vanilla at the bottom, and chocolate mousse on top.            
            Finished with whipped cream and chocolate shavings, this pie is every chocolate lover’s dream.            
            As it is a no-bake recipe, even non-experienced bakers can easily pull this off. It’s literally as easy as pie.</p>
